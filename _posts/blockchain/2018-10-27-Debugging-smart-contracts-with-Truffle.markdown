Bugs! Bugs are aliens that creep into a programmer's code at night when no one is watching and alter the state of 
a working code. These aliens have only one mission - to frustrate the life of a programmer. How does a programmer 
kill a bug before he dies of frustration? Yeah, you got it right! By debugging and removing the buggy code. 
But why would a programmer go into a debugging war without the right tools? If a programmer is going to debug he 
better do it the right way, using the right
tools.

>If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
 ~ [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)
 
In smart contract development, like traditional centralised software development, bugs creep into the smart contract 
developer's code during the development life cycle of the smart contract. While there are 'Etherillion' reasons why 
smart contracts could be buggy, one thing remains important, all bugs must be removed before the smart contract is 
deployed on the mainnet, or else, we risk losing funds and ultimately, the credibility of the smart contract.

There are several frameworks for developing smart contracts in solidity. In this article, the focus is on the Truffle 
Framework. [Truffle aims to make a developer's life easier by providing development environment, testing framework, and
debugging tools for smart contract development](https://truffleframework.com/truffle). Smart contract bugs can be hard
to find, and error messages can be very obscure. When building smart contracts using Truffle, the Truffle Debugger comes
in very handy when it is time to debug a contract. **_This is because when debugging a smart contract, you're not running
the code in real time; instead you are stepping into the historical execution of that transaction on the blockchain, and mapping that 
execution onto its associated code._** This process of debugging can be tedious to reason about traditionally, and this
is where the Truffle Debugger really helps - by allowing us to debug any transactions as long as we have the code and 
the artifacts of the transaction. Let's talk briefly about the Truffle Debugger and then take an example to show how this
tool can be used.

<br>
>Debugging is a cyclic activity involving execution testing and code correction.

### Truffle Debugger
Truffle Debugger is a command line tool integrated into the Truffle Framework which allows smart contract transactions 
to be debugged using the smart contract code and transaction artifacts. When the debugger is started, the command line
interface provides a list of addresses transacted against or created during the course of the transactions, an initial
entry point for the transaction and a list of available commands for using the debugger. Some of the debugger commands 
are highlighted below: 


<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/hjyCiA/step-by-step-redit.png">
</p>

`[o]  step over`: 

This command evaluates the instructions evaluated by the virtual machine relative to the contract until the next line in 
the current smart contract file, skipping the functions referenced at the current execution point(if any).

`[i]  step into`: 

This command steps into the function called at the current execution point.


`[u]  step out`: 

This command will have the debugger step out of the current function, to the next line executed right after it.

`[n]  step next`: 

This command steps to the next logical statement or expression in the current function called.

`[;]  step instruction`: 

This command steps through each individual instruction evaluated by the virtual machine.

You can check out other commands [here](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/debugging-your-contracts#debugging-interface)

Thus far, we have talked about debugging, and the Truffle Debugger, let's have an example to really drive this home.

<br>
### Debugging a FoodCart smart contract

The smart contract below models a simple food cart which allows any one to add food items to the cart for sale and
also allows anyone with enough ether to buy a food item off the cart. This contract is just for the purpose of illustration,
and it should not be used in a production environment. Before we start this example, the following are required to follow
this example without any issues:

1. Truffle 4.0 or above
2. Solidity compiler version 0.4.24 or above  
3. Private blockchain (Ganache CLI v6.1.6 or above)

<br>
#### `Step 1: Building the smart contract`
- Let's start by creating a directory for this project and building the smart contract
```solidity
$ mkdir FoodCart
``` 

- Enter into the folder and create a bare the truffle project.
```solidity
$ cd FoodCart
$ truffle init
```

- Navigate into the contracts folder and create a `FoodCart.sol` smart contract file 
```solidity
$ cd contracts
$ touch FoodCart.sol
```

- Open your FoodCart project in any IDE of your choice. I will be using Visual Studio code. Why? I really don't know ...lol. ðŸ˜‚. 
Open the `FoodCart.sol` contract and type in the smart contract below:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mayorcoded/1fd0b4361e273f18e6d56e30b24cdb36.js"></script>
Before we proceed any further, let me explain the smart contract above. The FoodCart smart contract can be sectioned 
into 6 parts:
- The state variables: The state variables `owner` and `skuCount` store the address of the owner and the count of food items 
added to the FoodCart respectively. The mapping `foodItems` maps skus to food items.

- The enum: The `State` enum is a user-defined data type that holds the state of the food items on the cart.
The types listed in the enum are explicitly convertible to and from integers, i.e (`ForSale = 0`, `Sold = 1`).

- The events: The events `ForSale` and `Sold` log the details of the food items that are put on sale or sold. These events
can be called by callbacks in javascript and their contents can be used to make using dApps more interactive.

- The struct: The struct `FoodItem` is a user-defined type which holds the properties of a food item. These properties
can be accessed using a dot notation on the struct.

- The function modifiers: The modifiers `doesFoodItemExist`, `isFoodItemForSale`, and `hasBuyerPaidEnough` are functions that
automatically check a condition prior to executing the function on which they are applied to. The role of the function
modifiers used in this smart contract are obvious from their names.

- The functions: The functions `addFoodItem`, `buyFoodItem` and `fetchFoodItem` adds food items to the contract, allows a food
item to be bought and allows the details of food item to be viewed respectively. The constructor function initializes
the `owner` state variable with the address that the contract is deployed on. The anonymous `payable` function allows
ether to the sent to this contract. 


<br>
#### `Step 2: Deploying the smart contract`
Let's deploy the smart contract on the private network.

- In your IDE, create a new file called `2_foodcart_migration.js` in the `migrations` folder. Open this file after 
creating it and add this code:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mayorcoded/402491027644ec6e8db5f0a2c6b5ea48.js"></script>
This piece of code will enable the framework to deploy our `FoodCart.sol` contract to the private blockchain.

- Open your terminal and navigate into the folder for this project and type this command:
```
FoodCart $ truffle develop
```
This command starts a development blockchain with which we can start testing our contract. Running that command should
produce this result: 
<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/b4qO8A/truffle-develop-compressed.png">
</p>

&emsp;&emsp; The image above shows that a development blockchain has been started on port &emsp;&emsp; 9545, test accounts have also been 
created for use, and the terminal is navigated to a &emsp;&emsp; new prompt `truffle(develop)>`.

- In the `truffle(develop)>` prompt, type the `compile` command to compile the contract. 
The result of the compilation is stored in the build folder of your project directory.
```javascript
truffle(develop)> compile
```
Running the `compile` command should produce this result: 

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/j1cOaq/compile-compressed.png">
</p>

- Finally, let's migrate the compiled contract to the blockchain for deployment. 
At the terminal, type the `migrate` command to migrate the contract to the development blockchain that has been 
started for us.
```javascript
truffle(develop)> migrate
```
Running the `migrate` command should produce this result: 

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/kSQJaq/migrate-compressed.png">
</p>

<br>
#### `Step 3: Interacting with the smart contract`
Let's interact with our smart contract and get a feel of how it works. We will be adding food items to the food cart,
checking the details of food items added to the cart, and also buy food items off the cart with Ether from one of the
accounts created for us when we started the development blockchain.

- Still in the `truffle(develop)>` prompt, create a `foodCart` variable and store the instance of the deployed contract in it.
```
truffle(develop)> let foodCart;
truffle(develop)> FoodCart.deployed().then((instance) => { foodCart = instance; });
```
In the short code snippet above, we access the deployed `FoodCart` contract via the web3 `.deployed` method which returns 
a promise interface and we pass
a function which stores the instance of the deployed contract in the `foodCart` variable. With the instance of the contract
stored in the `foodCart` variable, we can access the functions of the contract through the `foodCart` variable.

- Let's add some food items to the food cart by running the following code snippets at the `truffle(develop)>` prompt. First, let's
add a function that will help us add food items and print the result of the transaction at the console easily. 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mayorcoded/a545e2596475b0b89e14e394854a7a68.js"></script>
The `addFoodItemToCart` function allows us to easily add food items to the cart by passing the name and price of the food item
to the function as arguments when it is called. The function acts as a wrapper for the `addFoodItem` in the 
smart contract by making the smart contract calls for us and formating the log output returned from the function call. 
We can add some food items with the `addFoodItemToCart` function by running this commands:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mayorcoded/44442ca8a579f23a7a0fc111b4143d8d.js"></script>

- Now that we have about 3 food items on the the food cart, let's buy some food items off the cart. Before we can buy a
food item, we need to specify what address we will be using to make our purchase, because it is from this address that
we can get the funds `in ether` to buy food items. Recall that when we started our private blockchain, 10 test accounts 
were created for us and each of these accounts was credited with 100 ether which we can use to buy anything we want,
we are rich ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘. Let's create a variable to store one of these addresses or accounts so that we can easily call it anytime we want.
```
truffle(develop)> const buyerAddress = web3.eth.accounts[1];
truffle(develop)> buyerAddress
'0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732'
```
Since we have an account `0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732` (yours will be different), we can add a function
to buy food items off the food cart at our `truffle(develop)>` prompt. 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mayorcoded/7d2f2797870bb733c674fcfc536851d3.js"></script>
The `buyFoodItemFromCart` allows us to buy food items off the cart by calling the function with the `itemSku` and 
`amount` of the item. The amount to be paid for the item is taken from the account that was stored in our `buyerAddress`
variable. Let's buy Fried Rice off the food cart. From our previous transactions, we recall that the sku for Fried Rice 
is `0` and it's price is `10 wei`. So at the `truffle(develop)>` prompt, we call the `buyFoodItemFromCart` function with these values:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mayorcoded/029b231d62962b5bc6eb55e0dfc42851.js"></script>
From the output, we see that the state of the item is `Sold` and the `foodItemExist` is now `false`, indicating that this
item is no longer for sale.

<br>
#### `Step 4: Debugging errors in the smart contract`
If you have made it thus far, you deserve a Noble prize for Tenacity ðŸŽ–, enjoy the fame it brings. So far, we have seen
how the contract should behave. To be able to use the Truffle Debugger feature, we would introduce some errors while
interacting with the contract and then use the debugger to debug the error and get it fixed. To debug a transaction, we
need to have the hash of the transaction and then run command `debug [transaction hash]` at the `truffle(develop)>`
prompt followed by any of the debugger commands until we find out where the transaction failed.
 
We will try the following invalid transactions:
- Try to buy a food item that does not exist
- Try to pay an amount less than the price of a food item

Before we start these transactions, we need to start the `truffle develop logger` in another terminal, but still in the
sample project. Open a new terminal, navigate to the FoodCart project and run this command `truffle develop --log`.

```
FoodCart $ truffle develop --log
```
You should get this output:
```
Connected to existing Truffle Develop session at http://127.0.0.1:9545/
```
The logger connects to an existing session at the port specified, listens for transaction events, and logs the output 
of the transaction which should include items like transaction hash, block number, etc. Let's go ahead and make the life
of our contract a living hell ðŸ‘¹.

#### Invalid Transaction #1: Try to buy a food item that does not exist
From our previous transaction where we added food items to cart, we had skus `0, 1, 2` respectively for the 3 food items.
We will try to use the sku `6` to buy a food item that does not exist. 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mayorcoded/c95d154679e30afca4e6f34413588182.js"></script>
Trying to buy the item as shown in the command above produces the error 
`UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert ...` which does not really
tell us what or where the problem came from. Now this can be real headache when there's no debugger. I have spent many hours
trying to debug a smart contract without using the debugger and it can drain the last blood out of one. Let's have a look
at log output and see what we have there. 

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/mt9PJL/logger.png">
</p>


The most important content of the log to us is the transaction hash `0x90a2ef83e54426848523a4edcf0c9628045e03c69d95f989c5b3b557367c848c`,
this will be different from what you have on your machine. With the transaction hash, we can debug the transaction 
and figure out where the problem is. Let's debug this transaction. Copy the hash of the transaction from your debugger 
terminal and run this command: `debug your-trasanction-hash` at the `truffle(develop)>` prompt. Your output should look like this:

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/mVMtDL/debug1-compressed.png">
</p>
From the image, we see that when the debug command is run, the debugger compiles the contracts, gathers transaction data,
fetches the address that was affected and the contract that was deployed at that address, and shows a list of debugger
commands that we can use to interact with the debugger. The most interactive command to use at the debugger is the `step
next` command which steps through all the instructions executed during a transaction one at a time. The `step next`
command is executed by pressing `enter` or `n`, at the keyboard of course. 

At the `debug(develop:0x90a2ef83...)>` prompt, press enter continuously, following each instruction step until we reach
the instruction where the transaction failed. There are `8` steps before we reach the final instruction that halted our 
transaction - you will have to press enter 9 times to reach the halting instruction. Let's look at the first 4 steps from
this image below: 

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/hGbof0/first4steps-compressed.png">
</p>

From the image, we see that at line `61`, the `buyFoodItem` function was called, but before the execution of the 
function, the modifier `doesFoodItemExist` at line `64` was called to check if the food item to be bought exists in 
the cart. On further inspection, on line `33`, we see that the modifier uses the `require` function to ensure that
the `foodItemExist` property of the food item with the sku given is `true`. Let's check what happened in the rest of the 
steps in the image below:

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/d5cdf0/last5steps-compressed.png">
</p>

At last step on line 33 in the image above, we see that the transaction halted because the transaction failed the required
condition to be able to buy a food item from the cart. The item that we wanted to buy does not exist. The `require`
function throws a **state-reverting** exception when a condition to which it is applied to fails. A **state-reverting**
exception reverts or undo all changes made to the state in the current call (and all its sub-calls) and also flag an
error to the caller. We have been able to successfully debug this code using the Truffle Debugger, and it has been pretty
amazing.


#### Invalid Transaction #2: Try to pay an amount less than the price of a food item
In this transaction, we will try to buy a food item with less amount than the price of the food item. In 'step 3: 
Interacting with the smart contract', we added 3 food items. Let's try to buy 'Chicken Pepper Soup' with sku `1` and 
price `10 wei`. At the `truffle(develop)>` prompt, call the `buyFoodItem` function to buy a food item with less amount than the price. 
```
truffle(develop)> buyFoodItemFromCart(1, 5);
truffle(develop)> (node:40269) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert
```
Expectedly, this transaction fails, giving a cryptic error message as usual. To debug this transaction, we go to our 
log terminal and copy the hash of the transaction. On my machine the transaction hash is 
`0x5dc12d3ac524cfd1e3c0ea9265a155149ff16fcb18f904016a87e83cca5f9a30`. With this transaction hash, we shall debug the 
transaction and figure out where the transaction halted.
```
truffle(develop)> debug 0x2ad4c056a678f221d761d0bc11f641f6b4e63b3016587acd8b16ccf5295bd4d3
```
Like we did in the first debugging process, we will use the `step next` debugger command to step through the transactions 
as it is very interactive and shows all the instructions that have been executed until we reach the instruction that
halted the transaction. Use `enter` to step through the transaction history until you reach the instruction that 
halted the transaction as shown in the image below:

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/c7hQA0/last-debug-compressed.png">
</p>

In the image above, we see that at line 44, the modifier `hasBuyerPaidEnough` is called before the `buyFoodItemFromCart`
function is executed, and at line 45, the modifier requires that value sent by the buyer is greater than or equal to
the price of the item. However, we know that we flouted this condition hence, it halted our transaction. So if we send
the right amount, we will surely buy the food item we need.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the importance of a debugger while building smart contracts cannot be overemphasized. With a debugger,
we can test our modifiers to ensure that our contract behaves appropriately, we can ensure that our contracts are secure
by sending malicious transactions to our contract to see how it will behave and properly debug the transaction to see
the instructions that have been executed up until the transaction halted, if it did. Most importantly, we can save our
most valuable asset which is **time**, by using a debugger whenever we face issues with our smart contracts, instead of 
fumbling around with our code.
